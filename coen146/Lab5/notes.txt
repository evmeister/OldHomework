Lab 5
two programs, one generates a random sting of bytes, and the other calculates the entropy in that string. e.g. chars are one byte but are signed values so you need an unsigned char, 0-255, to get them all, where normal char only covers -127 to 218
gen a megabyte string: 1048576 bytes per string
- can use random number generator or something
- seed and rand are easiest; have a loop printing bytes. 
bonus to those who generate most random string of bytes

on source: first block reads in string, second block bins the values (histogram), third block does the calculation. need math.h lib and use -lm flag when compiling: gcc -lm -o execute code.c for entropycalc
./rand generator | ./entropycalc
entropy is summated, goes to stdout, use fread() stdin

download .zip file and make. execute ./ent along with the randgen to verify calculation

8.0 is max entropy
