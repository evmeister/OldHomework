CLIENT SIDE/Sender
gethostbyname
init sockaddr_in structure
open socket
//new
open loop{
take in text on stdn
send data to server/lisener
wait/recieve data from server
print text from server
}end loop
//best practice is to close any socket you open
close(socket);
//another function is called shutdown that flushes buffers

EXTRA CHALLENGE
when someone exits, notify other person. do on both ends:
add checks for exit string at stdin read and data recieve

SERVER SIDE/Listener
init sockaddr structure
open socket
bind socket
open loop{
wait/recieve data from client
print 
read stdin
send data to client
}end loop
close(socket);
