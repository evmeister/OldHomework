->Measure effective data rate

In report, answer: What is bandwidth
-effective data rate
-latency is part of overall time, part of overhead. time command gives 3
measures, user sys and real. real is cmd given to completion, includes
everything. time looking at data ignoring overhead  is user and sys. 

Deliverables: report, includes graph
- 8 to 10 data points
- consider scale and graph accordingly (expnential or linear etc)
- for loop back transmission, speed measure used to calc bandwidth

CMD Line instruction:
~	ssh-keygen -t rsa
~	*spam enter
~	mv ~./ssh/is_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
~	*laptop version follows
~	cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
~	dd if=/dev/zero of="test" bs=1024 count=1048576
~	*gives file of 1 gigabyte (quotes necessary?) replace 'zero' with 'rand'
	and makes random chars instead of straight zeroes
~	*transfer follows:
~	time cat test | head -c 1k | ssh username@linux.scudc.scu.edu "cd wd && cat -> somefile"
~	*-c flag allows choice of 1k bytes; | is 'pipe' symbol
~	* delete file when done
