Each 10ns column on the waveform corresponds with a test described in TestBench.v, in the order they are mentioned.

Module inputs and outputs are color coded. In general, brighter colors are control lines, primary colors are inputs, and darker colors are outputs.

The colors yellow and gold correspond to Imem.v.

The colors pink, red, and maroon correspond to Rfile.v

The colors cyan, blue, and navy correspond to Dmem.v
